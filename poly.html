                    Polytechnic education in India is growing at an immense rate with students opting for vocational courses. They provide several opportunities for students to be employable in different fields. Polytechnic courses are more career-based and students can pursue these right after completing their 10th.
                    <br>These are offer 2 and 3-year diploma.
                    <br>Polytechnic is a technical course which is a diploma in Engineering course. 
                    <br>This is a very popular course which can be done after passing 10th or 12th. After this you become a Junior Engineer and can apply for the post of Junior Engineer and can also Loco Pilot, Technical Assistant and apply for many government posts. 
                    <br>It is recognized as equivalent to Intermediate.
                    <br>If you go to do B.tech then you get admission directly in the second year.
                    <br>When you go for engineering after doing diploma then it is very easy for you and there is a right way to succeed in the field of engineering.
